# Practice-cli

A simple CLI application implementing some simple NodeJs/JavaScript features.

## About

I wrote this simple CLI app to demonstrate my familiarity with JavaScript/TypeScript and features therein. 

The app has the following features: 

* Name and location configuration
* Temperature display at user's location via RESTful call to Open-meteo API.
* Hangman game for one or two players
* Anime information display via GraphQl calls to Anilist API.

## Installation

You can run the CLI tool directly using npx without needing to install it globally.

To use the tool, run:

```sh
npx practice-cli-ditch19
```
